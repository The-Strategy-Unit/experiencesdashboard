My counsellor, Michael, proved to be a very good listener and projected an atmosphere of patience and calm during our counselling sessions. He enabled me to take back control of my life and proved to be very supportive and encouraging throughout the course of treatment.  Apart from that, I have nothing further to add other than that I would recommend this service without hesitation to anyone I knew who was suffering with mental health issues and needed help.","Care received",4,325,0,"Communication & involvement"

- 3 years ago there were health visitors to talk to while weighing which was needed when it's your 1st child. 
- Then 2018 there was a room with 3 scales and you had to do it yourself and now 2019 there is 1 scale and you have to queue up and wait.

Too much information to take in, this should be offered in book form so it?s easier to flick through.   Please check your letters before sending them out, if it states a leaflet ensure it has one. Local area should mean local, not in the next major town or city, Mental Health can make this very difficult especially if you can?t get any benefits or have anxiety about travel.   Do not send discharge letter from one course before enrolling into something else, this has made me feel abandoned.

It took quite a bit of time and practice, but gradually, I started to notice when an unhelpful thought was present. It gave me a breathing space between a distressing situation and my upsetting thoughts. It helps to take some of the heat out of distress. I`ve already recommended this technique to a friend.","Care received",-3,3842,0,"Communication & involvement, Staff"
